Cornelica Notes:

The files in need of translation contain both text that is displayed in-game, as well as actions for the game to perform(such as character movement). We don't want to translate anything regarding actions because that will break the references.

Here's what I've been able to tell so far from the symbols that begin each line-

@ symbol - any line starting with an @ symbol denotes an action for the game engine to take. We need to leave these alone.

[] symbols - lines starting with characters in brackets are displayed dialogue in game, starting with a character's name in the brackets, then the spoken text after

/CL - unknown, I believe it's for text that does not belong to a character, but for things like choices

;; - also unsure at this time

For item descriptions, it appears that the character limit is 70. Anything beyond that goes off the screen. I haven't found a way to start a new line.
